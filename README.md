# GlioVision
Given a biopsy slide of Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer, the GlioVision platform identifies
relevant tumor regions in the image, determines the molecular subtype of the tumor, and predicts the methylation status of MGMT
(which have important implications in chemotherapy treatment) with over 85%, 94%, and 96% accuracy, respectively, using deep learning. 
This biological problem has not been tackled in the literature and would allow oncologists to circumvent expensive and time-consuming 
genetic analysis.   

If you would like to request data to test GlioVision yourself, please contact the researcher!
